# COVID-19 Data Manipulation
***The data was last updated on:*** *2020-05-09 15:20 BST*

This is a small project to use some of the tools available in python to
visualise the current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and to make some
minor predictions based on the data.

Feel free to fork this project and improve upon it (I don't imagine it would be
too hard).
